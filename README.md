# Regression analysis - housing prices

In this group project, we used R to perform linear regression and LASSO to find the relationship between different variables and housing price. In the project, we demonstrated techniques such as using the `glm` functions and variable selection. We also used `ggplot` to create visuals that better communicate our finding and results.
